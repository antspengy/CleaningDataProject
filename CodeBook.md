### Codebook for variable_averages.txt
This codebook describes each variable and its values in the tidy data set
'variable_aveages.txt' generated by the run_analysis.R script.  More information about the 
script and the context of this data set is available in the README.md
file contained within this repository.

Each of the 180 observations within the file displays the average of 66 variables
extracted from the raw smartphone data set that related to measurements in the
raw data relating to the mean and standard deviation of movements of a
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by 30 subjects undertaking 6 different activities. 
The first two columns of the data set show the subject ID and the activity.
